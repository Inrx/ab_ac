"Palmela Beat, an electronic music festival, will celebrate 18 years of history and tradition in Palmela in 2024, representing a landmark event for our association. This festival is already well-known among young residents of Palmela, whether they have been regular attendees since its early editions or have discovered its unique character later on. Annually, Palmela hosts a night dedicated to electronic music.

After its successful debut in 2006, Palmela Beat established itself in 2007, remaining true to its original format during "Março a Partir," benefiting from financial support that allowed the presence of international artists. Notable names include Hosemeister (from Germany) in 2007, The Toxic Avenger (from France) in 2008, Fukkk Offf (Germany) in 2009, and, finally, Vicarious Bliss (English) in 2010. These renowned artists contributed to giving Palmela Beat a respectable dimension, with some editions recording around 1000 entries.

In 2024, we aim for the return of Palmela Beat to Palmela, once again integrated into "Março a Partir," but this time under the auspices of Ácido Base. This new edition of Palmela Beat will be revitalized and will feature two distinct phases. During the afternoon, the event will be open to the general public, taking place in the auditorium of Parque Venâncio Ribeiro da Costa - Amphitheater. In this phase, emerging DJs will be highlighted, exploring the world of lighter electronic music, a style accessible to a wide spectrum of the population. Additionally, we will establish partnerships with other associations to promote gastronomy and artistic entertainment.

In the evening, the party will move to the VILLA space, with restricted access from 10 pm to 4 am the next day. This second phase promises a more intimate and intense experience, providing participants with an exclusive and unforgettable atmosphere.

We believe that the renewal of Palmela Beat in 2024 will not only preserve the established tradition over the years but also contribute to the cultural and social vitality of Palmela. We kindly request your valuable support to ensure the success of this event, which has the potential to positively impact the local community and attract a diverse audience. We are confident that, with your collaboration, Palmela Beat can become a reference in the electronic music scene in Portugal.

Culturally developing young people in the municipality of Palmela is the central purpose of our event, which includes performing arts and music. In addition to promoting culture and leisure in the town, we aim to stimulate the local economy. The festival is planned to feature the participation of national and international electronic music artists, along with local DJs.

The revitalization of Parque Venâncio Ribeiro da Costa will be a crucial element of the event, with a program open to the public during the afternoon (4 pm-11 pm). This schedule will not only showcase the space to participants but also highlight the entire surrounding area of Castle, providing an enriching experience.

The daytime component will also include the promotion of a meeting space for young people and associations, in a free event for all participants (4 pm-11 pm). This initiative aims to strengthen community ties, providing a social environment and interaction among different age groups.

The nighttime component (10 pm-4 am) aims to reintroduce an event that was once part of Março a Partir, receiving positive feedback from participants in various previous editions. We highlight Palmela Beat as an important milestone in the musical panorama of the municipality, and its reintroduction aims not only to enrich the cultural offer but also to memorably mark the closing of the Março a Partir 2024 edition.

It is crucial to note that currently, there are no quality offerings in the field of electronic music on the south bank, and even more relevant is the fact that there are no nighttime entertainment attractions for young people in Palmela. Our event fills this gap, providing a unique experience and contributing to the cultural and social dynamism of the region. In this regard, we seek your support to make this project possible, whose potential impact is not limited only to the cultural development of youth but also to the promotion of the local economy and filling an existing gap in nighttime entertainment offerings in the region. We are confident that, with your support, we can organize an event that will leave a lasting mark on the Palmela community."
