# About Us

Founded in 2023, the Cultural Association "√Åcido Base" emerges as an innovative entity in the cultural scene of Palmela. We have meticulously prepared our inaugural event, the "Palmela Beat", with the promise of transforming Palmela into an epicenter of music and fun. What distinguishes us is the vast experience of our members in organizing musical events, accumulating years of experience in creating immersive experiences. Join us on this inaugural journey, where we not only celebrate music, but also highlight the expertise and passion of a dedicated team.
