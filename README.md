## Lessons Learned

This was the first website I created, ever. It was, the first time I deployed a website on Cloudflare Pages, thus there were a lot of lessons learned along the process. 

Several of these lessons needed some research, as there is a lot of informations scattered between Cloudflare and Hugo's Community support websites. 

I've created a [Wiki](https://github.com/Inrx/acidobase/wiki) that tried to bring all of that knowledge together in one place.
