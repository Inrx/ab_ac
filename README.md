## Lessons Learned

I want to share my experience of creating my first website and deploying it on Cloudflare Pages. Throughout the process, I learned many valuable lessons and had to do some research as there was a lot of scattered information between Cloudflare and Hugo's Community support websites.

To make things easier for others, I decided to create a [Wiki](https://github.com/Inrx/acidobase/wiki) that compiles all of this knowledge in one place.
